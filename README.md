Topographic analysis in python
================================

pyTopoTools is a collection of functions to quickly get a overview of topographic data. It provides the following functions,

* Powerspectrum analysis
* Frequency filters
* Local relief/Geophysical relief maps

The powerspectrum analysis is heavily based on the work of [Taylor Perron](http://web.mit.edu/perron/www/perron.html).
Orginally developed out of need this library is only maintained/updated when needed.

Documentation
---------------

The goal is selv-documenting code so no manual will be available. Below are a number of examples to show how to use the code.
